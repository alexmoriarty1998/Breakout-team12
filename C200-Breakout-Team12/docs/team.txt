Teamwork coordination and project goals:

TODO: Thursday client meeting
is current brick generation ("fill") acceptable?
low FPS

TODO:
make collisions displace ball in addition to flipping velocity
fix movement input (event-driven instead of polling)
add mouse input
custom chances for brick spawn based on HP (if fill mode is used)
clean up & comment code
