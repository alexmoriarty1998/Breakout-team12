Teamwork coordination and project goals:

Milestone 1 goals:
- 1. Display of brick layer at the top of the screen where each brick is an individual object.			11/28
- 2. Player paddle at the bottom of the screen.															11/21
- 3. A ball placed randomly between the bricks and the paddle and given a random initial direction.		11/21
- 4. Detection of when the ball hits a side wall and appropriate change in direction.					11/28
5. Detection of when the ball hits the ceiling and indication of a level completed.						11/28 and
6. Detection of when the ball hits the floor and indication of a level failed.							11/28 and
- 7. Player ability to control the paddle via keyboard or mouse interface.								11/22 and 11/28
8. Change in angle of reflection of the ball depending on where it hits the player paddle.				TBD
9. Destruction of a brick (removal from the set of bricks and from the display) when hit by the ball.	TBD

TODO: discuss at Wednesday's meeting
printing checklist from milestone 1 pdf

TODO: Milestone 1: basic features
- add default set of bricks - done SR 11/28
- move left/right press detection out of event loop (since events aren't used)
collision onto bricks, appropriate bouncing
win/loss notifications
implement angle detection for collisions, use for part 8
use ^ to fix buggy paddle/ball collision detection and to handle side collisions
	also use to have advanced brick collisions

TODO: Milestone 1: post-completion
add gravity to ball
add good brick generation
fix movement input (event-driven instead of polling)
clean up & comment code
add statement for commits from shared work
fix bug: paddle not initially centered on screen
