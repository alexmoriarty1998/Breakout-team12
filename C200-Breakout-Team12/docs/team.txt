BUGS:
Paddle electric animation doesn't work on left side...

TODO:
Level 4 is too hard

Animations:
	brick fragments - add more types
	lost explosion - need to delay going to highscores screen to show this


###############################################################################
TODO Before final submission:
Complete any remaining TODOs
Cleanup and comment code
Check import into Visual Studio

Executive Summary:
Scoring is nonlinear
Didn't use pygame.font
Ball initial position was fixed to one point instead of random
GameController needs to discard mouse motion events if in main menu screen (can't clear in MainMenuScreen code)
Pause screen & motion blur disabled on mac (no paddle movement; lag) as well as low FPS in general on mac
The paddle movement in the main menu screen can be improved
Low performance mode (CPU bottlenecked)
Ball slowing down & randomly fail to quit - fixed??
