	Juice: http://grapefrukt.com/f/games/juicy-breakout/
		not speed based:
			bricks smash apart into fragments on destroyed
			brick dust on cracking
			explosions on lost life
			confetti on win(? might be hard)
			animations for other stuff
		speed-based:
			dust/smoke/explosion animation on hit wall or boss brick
			electric animation on hit paddle: http://www.video-games.io/pong/
			SCREENSHAKE
			ball stretch/squash (have 3 different levels, based on ball speed)

	Game playing in main menu background, and pause screen, and prettify UI (three smaller features)

	Powerups

BUGS:
ball loses speed

TODO:
Level 4 is too hard

Animations:
	brick dust & crack
	paddle electric
	screenshake
	lost explosion - need to delay going to highscores screen to show this

###############################################################################
TODO Before final submission:
Complete any remaining TODOs
Cleanup and comment code

Executive Summary:
Scoring is nonlinear
Didn't use pygame.font
Ball initial position was fixed to one point instead of random
GameController needs to discard mouse motion events if in main menu screen (can't clear in MainMenuScreen code)
Pause screen & motion blur disabled on mac (no paddle movement; lag) as well as low FPS in general on mac
The paddle movement in the main menu screen can be improved
